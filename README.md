**Actual Process**



    **ItemPreparation**
    
    2.prepare the data by hitting the API using Postman 
        a.Create 10 items in item table using postman using below url and body in json;
            POST: http://localhost:8991/item        (for save/update)
            with body like below:
            
            
            {
            	"id":1,
            	"name":"pencil",
            	"qty":100,
            	"price":20
            }
            
            like that prepare more or less 10 items so that one can order more than one item;
    3.once the data is prepared 
        test these data using  GET:- http://localhost:8991/item
            it will list all the item with its id;
            using these itemId we are going to order items;
    4. one can delete the item using DELETE:-http://localhost:8991/item?id=2    here id is itemid
    
    
    
    
    
    Placing the Order 
    
    single/bulk order by customer
    5.  POST:-localhost:8991/order
    
    A customer can order single or multiple item or more then one quantity of single item changing the payload
    
    
      
      
      
     payload for single item be like :-
     
     {
     	"orderId":1,
     	"orderedItems":[ 
     		{
     		"id":5,
     		"itemId":1,
     		"qty":1
     		}
     	],
     	"emailId":"vikram19977@gmail.com"
     }
     
     
     payload for more than one quantity of single item
          {
          	"orderId":1,
          	"orderedItems":[ 
          		{
          		"id":5,
          		"itemId":1,
          		"qty":4
          		}
          	],
          	"emailId":"vikram19977@gmail.com"
          }
         
         
          
      payload for more then one item 
     
       {
            "orderId":1,
            "orderedItems":[ 
                {
                "id":5,
                "itemId":1,
                "qty":1
                },
                 {
                    "id":5,
                    "itemId":1,
                    "qty":1
                 }
            ],
            "emailId":"testuser@gmail.com"
        }  
        
        
       i. If we have happy path means order is placed  then we will get the message like ::
        'sample output'-  "Order Placed...!  you have spent :"+xxxx +" Rupees";  xxxx=calculated total spent amount;
       
       
       
       ii. for any of the exception like out of stock item we have various messages coming to the customer accordinglg
      
      
      
      It is already tested by various component test cases written in test folder 
      for both ItemController and OrderController;
